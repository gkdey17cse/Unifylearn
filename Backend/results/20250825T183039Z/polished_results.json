    "description": "Once you have an understanding of what compliance is, and why it may be important, it is natural to wonder next, “What should I do about it?”  In this course, we’ll explore one of the key factors for creating a positive culture of compliance: human psychology. We’ll think about what drives us, what makes us pay attention, what distracts, and how all of these pieces help build a strong belief in an organizational culture of compliance. ",
