      "What you learn": "“Machine learning” sounds intimidating, but in reality it is far more accessible than people think. This course is tailored for both students and professionals looking to improve their understanding of supervised machine learning methods (i.e. regression and classification techniques) so they can run their own predictive algorithms, as well as contribute meaningfully to other teams’ ML projects. In addition to working through a range of hands-on exercises, you’ll also apply what you’ve learned to predict potential donors for a fictional charity based on census data. ",

If you have no programming experience, you should consider taking Udacity’s Introduction to Computer Science course before attempting this one.The math used will be centered on probability and linear algebra. You don’t need to be an expert in either, but some familiarity with concepts in probability (e.g. probabilities must add to one, conditional probability, and Bayes’ rule) will be extremely helpful. It is possible to learn these concepts during the course, but it will take more work. Knowledge of linear algebra, while helpful, is not required.See the Technology Requirements for using Udacity.",
