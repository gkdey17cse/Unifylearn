        "Prequisites": "Success in this course requires some programming experience and some mathematical fluency. Programming in this course is done in Python. We will use some basic object-oriented concepts to model robot motion and perception. If you don’t know Python but have experience with another language, you should be able to pick up the syntax fairly quickly. If you have no programming experience, you should consider taking Udacity’s Introduction to Computer Science course before attempting this one.The math used will be centered on probability and linear algebra. You don’t need to be an expert in either, but some familiarity with concepts in probability (e.g. probabilities must add to one, conditional probability, and Bayes’ rule) will be extremely helpful. It is possible to learn these concepts during the course, but it will take more work. Knowledge of linear algebra, while helpful, is not required.See the Technology Requirements for using Udacity.",
