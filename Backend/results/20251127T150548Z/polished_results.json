Some of the exercises in this course involve using a Unix-style command-line interface to enter commands, run Python programs, and navigate directories.\r\nIf you have taken our course on Git and Github, the level of command-line use in this course is similar.\r\nYou don't need to be a Web programmer. This course does include a small Web application and some HTML and JavaScript in examples, but you will not need to make changes in these languages.\r\nYou don't need any previous database experience. This course is an entry-level introduction to relational databases.\r\nYou need a programming text editor (such as Sublime Text) installed on your computer.

The course also assumes basic familiarity with Git. Specifically, you will need to be able to clone Git repositories and checkout branches specific to each lesson. How to Use Git & GitHub is a great option if you need to brush up on these skills.You will need access to a Mac computer running OS X 10.10 or later. However, you do not need an iPad or iPhone to complete the activities. All exercises can be completed using the iOS simulator built into Xcode.See the Technology Requirements for using Udacity.",

You will explore a number of significant adjustments required by your body in order to properly respond to the physical stress of exercise, including changes in carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism, nutritional considerations, causes of muscle soreness  fatigue, and the effectiveness and dangers of performance enhancing drugs. Active learning assessments will challenge you to apply this new knowledge via nutrition logs, heart rate monitoring, calculations of your total daily caloric expenditure and body mass index BMI. Finally, learners will examine the scientific evidence for the health benefits of exercise including the prevention and treatment of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, obesity weight loss, depression, and dementia.",
