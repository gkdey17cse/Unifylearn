However, completion of that class isn't required for success.  We will also use a tiny bit of git, which you can also learn about on Udacity.One thing that we don’t require is previous exposure to machine learning.

This course is tailored for both students and professionals looking to improve their understanding of supervised machine learning methods (i.e. regression and classification techniques) so they can run their own predictive algorithms, as well as contribute meaningfully to other teams’ ML projects. In addition to working through a range of hands-on exercises, you’ll also apply what you’ve learned to predict potential donors for a fictional charity based on census data. ",

First, you will develop Machine Learning Engineering applications and use software development best practices to create Machine Learning Engineering applications. Then, you will learn to use AutoML to solve problems more efficiently than traditional machine learning approaches alone. Finally, you will dive into emerging topics in Machine Learning including MLOps, Edge Machine Learning and AI APIs. ",

Next, we learn how to calculate vectors that point up hill on multidimensional surfaces and even put this into action using an interactive game. We take a look at how we can use calculus to build approximations to functions, as well as helping us to quantify how accurate we should expect those approximations to be. We also spend some time talking about where calculus comes up in the training of neural networks, before finally showing you how it is applied in linear regression models.

In theory, this provides unprecedented opportunities to understand and shape society.

Data is the fuel, but machine learning it the motor to extract remarkable new knowledge from vasts amounts of data. Since an important part of this data is about ourselves, using algorithms in order to learn more about ourselves naturally leads to ethical questions. Therefore, we cannot finish this course without also talking about research ethics and about some of the old and new lines computational social scientists have to keep in mind.

    "description": "Machine Learning, often called Artificial Intelligence or AI, is one of the most exciting areas of technology at the moment. We see daily news stories that herald new breakthroughs in facial recognition technology, self driving cars or computers that can have a conversation just like a real person. Machine Learning technology is set to revolutionise almost any area of human life and work, and so will affect all our lives, and so you are likely to want to find out more about it. Machine Learning has a reputation for being one of the most complex areas of computer science, requiring advanced mathematics and engineering skills to understand it. While it is true that working as a Machine Learning engineer does involve a lot of mathematics and programming, we believe that anyone can understand the basic concepts of Machine Learning, and given the importance of this technology, everyone should. The big AI breakthroughs sound like science fiction, but they come down to a simple idea: the use of data to train statistical algorithms. In this course you will learn to understand the basic idea of machine learning, even if you dont have any background in math or programming. Not only that, you will get hands on and use user friendly tools developed at Goldsmiths, University of London to actually do a machine learning project: training a computer to recognise images. This course is for a lot of different people. It could be a good first step into a technical career in Machine Learning, after all it is always better to start with the high level concepts before the technical details, but it is also great if your role is non-technical. You might be a manager or other non-technical role in a company that is considering using Machine Learning. You really need to understand this technology, and this course is a great place to get that understanding. Or you might just be following the news reports about AI and interested in finding out more about the hottest new technology of the moment. Whoever you are, we are looking forward to guiding you through you first machine learning project.",

    "description": "CONGRATULATIONS! Not only did you accomplish to finish our intellectual tour de force, but, by now, you also already have all required skills to execute a comprehensive multi-method workflow of computational social science. We will put these skills to work in this final integrative lab, where we are bringing it all together. We scrape data from a social media site drawing on the skills obtained in the 1st course of this specialization. We then analyze the collected data by visualizing the resulting networks building on the skills obtained in the 3rd course. We analyze some key aspects of it in depth, using machine learning powered natural language processing putting to work the insights obtained during the 2nd course. Finally, we use a computer simulation model to explore possible generative mechanism and scrutinize aspects that we did not find in our empirical reality, but that help us to improve this aspect of society drawing on the skills obtained during the 4th course of this specialization. The result is the first glimpse at a new way of doing social science in a digital age: computational social science. Congratulations! Having done all of this yourself, you can consider yourself a fledgling computational social scientist!",

Not only did you accomplish to finish our intellectual tour de force, but, by now, you also already have all required skills to execute a comprehensive multi-method workflow of computational social science. We will put these skills to work in this final integrative lab, where we are bringing it all together. We scrape data from a social media site (drawing on the skills obtained in the 1st course of this specialization). We then analyze the collected data by visualizing the resulting networks (building on the skills obtained in the 3rd course). We analyze some key aspects of it in depth, using machine learning powered natural language processing (putting to work the insights obtained during the 2nd course).

      "Short Intro": "In Microsoft Azure, the Computer Vision cognitive service uses pre-trained models to analyze images, enabling software developers to easily build applications\"see\" the world and make sense of it. This ability to process images is the key to creating software that can emulate human visual perception. In this course, you'll explore some of these capabilities as you learn how to use the Computer Vision service to analyze images.",

We will use some basic object-oriented concepts to model robot motion and perception. If you don’t know Python but have experience with another language, you should be able to pick up the syntax fairly quickly. If you have no programming experience, you should consider taking Udacity’s Introduction to Computer Science course before attempting this one.The math used will be centered on probability and linear algebra. You don’t need to be an expert in either, but some familiarity with concepts in probability (e.g. probabilities must add to one, conditional probability, and Bayes’ rule) will be extremely helpful. It is possible to learn these concepts during the course, but it will take more work. Knowledge of linear algebra, while helpful, is not required.See the Technology Requirements for using Udacity.",
