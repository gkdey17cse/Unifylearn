      "Prequisites": "Regardless of your programming background, you can learn about data visualization and design principles in Lesson 1a and Lesson 2a without the following recommended background.To succeed in this course, you should to be familiar with basic programming principles, including data types (strings, arrays, booleans, etc.), if else statements, and for loops. You should also be able to describe concepts like functions and objects. Our Intro to Computer Science and Programming Fundamentals with Python courses are great places to get started.Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS (structuring and styling a web page) is not required but highly recommended. We suggest taking the Intro to HTML and CSS course if you have no experience with HTML or CSS.This course is unique in that the final project can be completed using either dimple.js or d3.js. The visualization library, dimple.js, is easier to use than d3.js and requires less background knowledge. Furthermore, a graphic can be created in considerably fewer lines of code using dimple.js as opposed to d3.js.So why should you learn d3.js?Data Driven Documents (d3.js) allows you to build highly customized graphics. If you would like to gain more technical skills and learn more about Javascript and open web standards, then you should complete Lesson 3 and Lesson 4 in order to prepare for the final project.If you would like to complete the final project using d3.js, you should have some experience reading and using documentation. For example, you should be able to code a for loop in Javascript or be able to look up the syntax to work with strings and arrays in Javascript. We recommend taking the Javascript Basics course if you have little to no experience with Javascript.See the Technology Requirements for using Udacity.",

In this lesson you’ll learn how and when (and why) to use master-detail and lookup relationships in the apps you build.Many-to-Many Relationships: You’ll learn how to use a junction object to add flexibility into your data model.Customizing the User Interface: Good apps should be easy to use! In this lesson you’ll learn how to configure the layout of your app to make sure the UI is simple and intuitive.Schema Builder: There are many ways to get things done in Salesforce.

      "Prequisites": "You can read and write basic code in Python. This course uses programming exercises in Python. If you haven't worked with Python before, check out our course Programming Foundations with Python.\r\nIf you can understand this code (maybe with the help of the random module documentation), you know enough Python for this course:\r\nimport random\r\n\r\ndef ChooseTwice(items):\r\n    a = random.choice(items)\r\n    b = random.choice(items)\r\n    return a, b\r\n\r\nnames = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\", \"Debra\"]\r\n(one, two) = ChooseTwice(names)\r\nif one == two:\r\n    print \"%s is happy!\" % one\r\nelse:\r\n    print \"%s likes %s!\" % (one, two)\r\n\r\nYou can use a command-line interface (terminal). Some of the exercises in this course involve using a Unix-style command-line interface to enter commands, run Python programs, and navigate directories.\r\nIf you have taken our course on Git and Github, the level of command-line use in this course is similar.\r\nYou don't need to be a Web programmer. This course does include a small Web application and some HTML and JavaScript in examples, but you will not need to make changes in these languages.\r\nYou don't need any previous database experience. This course is an entry-level introduction to relational databases.\r\nYou need a programming text editor (such as Sublime Text) installed on your computer. You should be able to use it to open and edit files of Python code.See the Technology Requirements for using Udacity.",

We will use some basic object-oriented concepts to model robot motion and perception. If you don’t know Python but have experience with another language, you should be able to pick up the syntax fairly quickly. If you have no programming experience, you should consider taking Udacity’s Introduction to Computer Science course before attempting this one.The math used will be centered on probability and linear algebra. You don’t need to be an expert in either, but some familiarity with concepts in probability (e.g. probabilities must add to one, conditional probability, and Bayes’ rule) will be extremely helpful. It is possible to learn these concepts during the course, but it will take more work. Knowledge of linear algebra, while helpful, is not required.See the Technology Requirements for using Udacity.",

To follow the material in this course, you'll need to enter commands into the shell and make sense of their output. You'll use command-line programs like ping and tcpdump to gather information about computers on the network.You have used the Internet. If you're looking at this page, you pass this requirement! This course does not assume that you are configuring routers or building firewalls in your spare time. It is really intended as an introduction.You have access to a Linux system to run commands. If you're taking this course as part of a Udacity Nanodegree program, you can use the Linux-based development environment that we have set up for you. Find out how to access it here. Many of the practical exercises in this course can be done using another Unix-like shell environment, but you may get different results for some exercises.See the Technology Requirements for using Udacity.",
