        "description": "This course begins with an overview of general intellectual property law in the United States, then examines how the policy choices behind those laws shapes the behavior of major players in the healthcare industry. We will examine how patents and trademarks shape the behavior of pharmaceutical companies, and how complex issues involving medical research in university settings, and ownership of genetic information and material, are resolved by intellectual property laws. The course concludes with in-depth case studies of an international pharmaceutical company, a major medical device company, and a start-up in the emerging DNA-testing industry.",

        "Short Intro": "This course serves as an introduction to the physics of electricity and magnetism.  Upon completion, learners will have an understanding of how the forces between electric charges are described by fields, and how these fields are related to electrical circuits. They will gain experience in solving physics problems with tools such as graphical analysis, algebra, vector analysis, and calculus.  The course follows the typical progression of topics of a first-semester university physics course:  charges, electric forces, electric fields potential, magnetic fields, currents, magnetic moments, electromagnetic induction, and circuits.  Each module contains reading links to a free textbook, complete video lectures, conceptual quizzes, and a set of homework problems.  Once the modules are completed, the course ends with an exam.  This comprehensive course series is similar in detail and rigor to what is taught on-campus.  It will thoroughly prepare learners for their upcoming introductory physics courses, or more advanced courses in physics.",

You will remind how Newton's 2nd law allows you to determine what force must be applied on an apple - or on an airplane, to modify the magnitude and direction of its speed. Coming back on the concepts of kinetic energy and potential energy, you will discover the very useful concept of total height and you will be able to explain how an airplane can quickly exchange speed for altitude, while changes in total height are much slower.
