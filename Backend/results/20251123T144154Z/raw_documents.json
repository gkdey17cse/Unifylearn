You’ll learn what these terms mean and build them into your app.Relationships: When the pieces of your app start communicating, interesting things can happen. In this lesson you’ll learn the basics of Salesforce relationship fields.Validation Rules: If you’ve ever incorrectly entered your credit card number into a website, you already know about validation rules. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to build them into your app.Formulas and Summaries: These tools let you easily keep track of quantifiable things like money spent, customers contacted, or tickets sold.

In this lesson you’ll learn how and when (and why) to use master-detail and lookup relationships in the apps you build.Many-to-Many Relationships: You’ll learn how to use a junction object to add flexibility into your data model.Customizing the User Interface: Good apps should be easy to use! In this lesson you’ll learn how to configure the layout of your app to make sure the UI is simple and intuitive.Schema Builder: There are many ways to get things done in Salesforce. In this lesson you’ll start using the schema builder to understand how your app works.Data Loading: This is a convenient way to get lots of data onto your app at once.One-to-Many Relationships: These relationships let the pieces of your app talk to each other.

A dashboard is a collection of charts that give specific people in your organization exactly the information that they need in real-time.Views: Data is good, but sometimes you have too much.

Workflows let you automate processes like these, such as sending an email, assigning a task, or updating a field.Approval Processes: You don’t want every job to be completely automated. Sometimes you need someone to step in and say “this looks good.” Approval processes add a human element to your automated tasks.Workflows: There are situations where a series of steps need to happen in sequence: first do this, then do that.
