For iOS apps, you'll use strings for labels, buttons, and any text in a user interface, but you'll also need them for behind-the-scenes processing. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to create and manipulate strings using their powerful built-in features.In this lesson, you’ll learn how to represent a sequence of characters, or in other words, a string!

You'll also learn about the counterpart to if statements called \"else\" statements. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to specify conditions for when Swift code should be executed based on logic that you define.In this lesson, you’ll learn how to control when and how Swift code is executed by using if statements.

In this lesson you’ll learn how and when (and why) to use master-detail and lookup relationships in the apps you build.Many-to-Many Relationships: You’ll learn how to use a junction object to add flexibility into your data model.Customizing the User Interface: Good apps should be easy to use! In this lesson you’ll learn how to configure the layout of your app to make sure the UI is simple and intuitive.Schema Builder: There are many ways to get things done in Salesforce.

A dashboard is a collection of charts that give specific people in your organization exactly the information that they need in real-time.Views: Data is good, but sometimes you have too much.
