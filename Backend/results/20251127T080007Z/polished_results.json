You’ll learn what these terms mean and build them into your app.Relationships: When the pieces of your app start communicating, interesting things can happen. In this lesson you’ll learn the basics of Salesforce relationship fields.Validation Rules: If you’ve ever incorrectly entered your credit card number into a website, you already know about validation rules. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to build them into your app.Formulas and Summaries: These tools let you easily keep track of quantifiable things like money spent, customers contacted, or tickets sold.

In this lesson you’ll learn how and when (and why) to use master-detail and lookup relationships in the apps you build.Many-to-Many Relationships: You’ll learn how to use a junction object to add flexibility into your data model.Customizing the User Interface: Good apps should be easy to use! In this lesson you’ll learn how to configure the layout of your app to make sure the UI is simple and intuitive.Schema Builder: There are many ways to get things done in Salesforce. In this lesson you’ll start using the schema builder to understand how your app works.Data Loading: This is a convenient way to get lots of data onto your app at once.One-to-Many Relationships: These relationships let the pieces of your app talk to each other.

Computer simulations allow us to study why societies are the way they are, and to dream about the world we would like to live in. This can be as intuitive as playing a video game. Much like the well-known video game SimCity is used to build and manage an artificial city, we use agent-based models to grow and study artificial societies. Without hurting anyone in the real world, computer simulations allow us explore how to make the world a better place. We play hands-on with several practical computer simulation models and explore how we can combine hypothetical models with real world data. Finally, you will program a simple artificial society yourself, bottom-up. This will allow you to feel the complexity that arises when designing social systems, while at the same time experiencing the ease with which our new computational tools allow us to pursue such daunting endeavors.",

We scrape data from a social media site drawing on the skills obtained in the 1st course of this specialization. We then analyze the collected data by visualizing the resulting networks building on the skills obtained in the 3rd course. We analyze some key aspects of it in depth, using machine learning powered natural language processing putting to work the insights obtained during the 2nd course. Finally, we use a computer simulation model to explore possible generative mechanism and scrutinize aspects that we did not find in our empirical reality, but that help us to improve this aspect of society drawing on the skills obtained during the 4th course of this specialization. The result is the first glimpse at a new way of doing social science in a digital age: computational social science. Congratulations!

We see daily news stories that herald new breakthroughs in facial recognition technology, self driving cars or computers that can have a conversation just like a real person. Machine Learning technology is set to revolutionise almost any area of human life and work, and so will affect all our lives, and so you are likely to want to find out more about it. Machine Learning has a reputation for being one of the most complex areas of computer science, requiring advanced mathematics and engineering skills to understand it. While it is true that working as a Machine Learning engineer does involve a lot of mathematics and programming, we believe that anyone can understand the basic concepts of Machine Learning, and given the importance of this technology, everyone should. The big AI breakthroughs sound like science fiction, but they come down to a simple idea: the use of data to train statistical algorithms. In this course you will learn to understand the basic idea of machine learning, even if you dont have any background in math or programming. Not only that, you will get hands on and use user friendly tools developed at Goldsmiths, University of London to actually do a machine learning project: training a computer to recognise images. This course is for a lot of different people. It could be a good first step into a technical career in Machine Learning, after all it is always better to start with the high level concepts before the technical details, but it is also great if your role is non-technical. You might be a manager or other non-technical role in a company that is considering using Machine Learning.

      "Prequisites": "Regardless of your programming background, you can learn about data visualization and design principles in Lesson 1a and Lesson 2a without the following recommended background.To succeed in this course, you should to be familiar with basic programming principles, including data types (strings, arrays, booleans, etc.), if else statements, and for loops. You should also be able to describe concepts like functions and objects. Our Intro to Computer Science and Programming Fundamentals with Python courses are great places to get started.Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS (structuring and styling a web page) is not required but highly recommended. We suggest taking the Intro to HTML and CSS course if you have no experience with HTML or CSS.This course is unique in that the final project can be completed using either dimple.js or d3.js. The visualization library, dimple.js, is easier to use than d3.js and requires less background knowledge. Furthermore, a graphic can be created in considerably fewer lines of code using dimple.js as opposed to d3.js.So why should you learn d3.js?Data Driven Documents (d3.js) allows you to build highly customized graphics. If you would like to gain more technical skills and learn more about Javascript and open web standards, then you should complete Lesson 3 and Lesson 4 in order to prepare for the final project.If you would like to complete the final project using d3.js, you should have some experience reading and using documentation. For example, you should be able to code a for loop in Javascript or be able to look up the syntax to work with strings and arrays in Javascript. We recommend taking the Javascript Basics course if you have little to no experience with Javascript.See the Technology Requirements for using Udacity.",

This course will provide you with an introduction to some of the most basic methods in the emerging fields of consumer neuroscience and neuromarketing. You will learn about the methods employed and what they mean. You will learn about the basic brain mechanisms in consumer choice, and how to stay updated on these topics. The course will give an overview of the current and future uses of neuroscience in business.",

      "Short Intro": "Change is inevitable and so are the digital disruptions in every industry. What’s important from a business perspective is to align and adapt to such digital disruptions. In today’s competitive business market, the key to success is wise data-driven decisions, made based on reliable information. As part of your work responsibilities, you would have discovered, synthesized, and analyzed information collected from various sources at some point in time. This is Business Analysis. It is the set of tasks, knowledge, and techniques required to identify business needs and determine solutions to enterprise business problems. Like we said earlier, a plethora of digital disruptions are taking place in every industry. We are witnessing the growth of a digital-ready culture with automation at its helm. Automation generates productivity boosts at the process, workflow, and workforce levels, thereby shaping organizational growth and longevity. With organizations moving towards automation, it’s of paramount importance for a Business Analyst to be skilled with the science of automation to facilitate communication and collaboration with relevant stakeholders. As a strong proponent of Robotic Process Automation (RPA), UiPath brings in the Automation Business Analyst role, who will be responsible for analyzing business requirements, identifying possible automatable processes as well as potential pitfalls, along with assessing the impact of automation implementation. Through this course, you will learn techniques for ensuring project success at every step-from understanding the enterprise problems or goals, to designing solutions, devising strategies, and thereby, driving change.  Along with the foundational business analysis skills, you will also learn how to incorporate business analysis deliverables and models into an RPA specific Process Definition Document (PDD), which is the representation of ‘as-is’ business processes that are chosen for automation. Throughout this course the terms ‘Robotic Process Automation’ (RPA) and ‘Automation’ have been used interchangeably. Aligned with IIBA's BABOK, this course will help you take the first step in your Business Analyst journey and will aid you with preparation for ECBA (Entry Certificate in Business Analysis).To complete this course, you will need IIBA’s BABOK Guide, which can be accessed at no additional cost.",

We have organized this experience around the journey of a patient who develops some respiratory symptoms and given the concerns around COVID19 seeks care with a primary care provider. We will follow the patients journey from the lens of the data that are created at each encounter, which will bring us to a unique de-identified dataset created specially for this specialization. The data set spans EHR as well as image data and using this dataset, we will build models that enable risk-stratification decisions for our patient. We will review how the different choices you make -- such as those around feature construction, the data types to use, how the model evaluation is set up and how you handle the patient timeline -- affect the care that would be recommended by the model.

      "Short Intro": "This capstone project takes you on a guided tour exploring all the concepts we have covered in the different classes up till now. We have organized this experience around the journey of a patient who develops some respiratory symptoms and given the concerns around COVID19 seeks care with a primary care provider. We will follow the patient's journey from the lens of the data that are created at each encounter, which will bring us to a unique de-identified dataset created specially for this specialization. The data set spans EHR as well as image data and using this dataset, we will build models that enable risk-stratification decisions for our patient. We will review how the different choices you make -- such as those around feature construction, the data types to use, how the model evaluation is set up and how you handle the patient timeline -- affect the care that would be recommended by the model. During this exploration, we will also discuss the regulatory as well as ethical issues that come up as we attempt to use AI to help us make better care decisions for our patient.

    "description": "Have you ever wondered how products and services are created exactly the same thousands of times over? And how companies are able to smooth out operations to manufacture efficiently, effectively, and without any waste? How is such precision possible? The answer lies at the heart of operations. In the Supply Chain Operations course, we introduce and apply essential process improvement tools to achieve perfection. After completing this course, you will be able to apply the Six Sigma methodology for process improvement. You will demonstrate that you understand the basic tenets of the Lean philosophy that enables manufacturers to eliminate waste and make processes more efficient. Finally, you will be able to apply the tools that you just gained to improve a process of your own. This is an introductory course designed to provide you with a start on your learning journey in operations. You do not need to have any background in operations, but it would be beneficial if you had a basic understanding of business concepts, a working knowledge of spreadsheets, and ideally have mastered the Supply Chain Logistics course.

We’ll teach you how to light an interview to help your subject look their best. Think of your footage as visual evidence that shows, not just tells your story.",

While the information you will explore is general, it will help you establish a solid foundation for continued learning and future thinking about the concept of VBC. Through a historical lens, you will explore the creation of Medicare and Medicaid and the evolution of commercial insurance, TRICARE, and the Veterans Health Administration. While history is an important filter for understanding healthcare in this country, you will learn how each of these mechanisms emerged, the populations served, and what changes occurred over time, with a focus on funding and expenditures. In addition, this course will help you establish a firm foundation for understanding the development and evolution of quality measures and outcomes in healthcare. By developing an understanding of what quality is and how it is measured, you can begin a knowledge-building exploration of the components of quality in healthcare. Why is this important? In value-based care models, providers must meet quality measures and improve the health outcomes of their patients. In the summative assignment, you will use a national system of quality measures to develop a plan that would positively impact value within your healthcare organization.",

It outlines a step-by-step approach to qualitative research design that begins by identifying a public health topic of interest, works to hone in on a specific research problem, and then specifies research questions, objectives, and specific aims. The course emphasizes the iterative nature of research design in qualitative inquiry and highlights the importance of specifying a population of interest, an appropriate sampling strategy, and potential approaches to recruitment. It introduces the relationship between these considerations and key concepts such as saturation and transferability in qualitative research. Finally, the course considers ethical concerns specific to qualitative research and potential solutions. Learners of this course will not only be able to put what they learn into practice, but theyll also develop a portfolio of qualitative research materials for career advancement.",

The first module will introduce different types of options in the market, followed by an in-depth discussion into numerical techniques helpful in pricing them, e.g. Fourier Transform FT and Fast Fourier Transform FFT methods. We will explain models like Black-Merton-Scholes BMS, Heston, Variance Gamma VG, which are central to understanding stock price evolution, through case studies and Python codes. The second module introduces concepts like bid-ask prices, implied volatility, and option surfaces, followed by a demonstration of model calibration for fitting market option prices using optimization routines like brute-force search, Nelder-Mead algorithm, and BFGS algorithm. The third module introduces interest rates and the financial products built around these instruments. We will bring in fundamental concepts like forward rates, spot rates, swap rates, and the term structure of interest rates, extending it further for creating, calibrating, and analyzing LIBOR and swap curves. We will also demonstrate the pricing of bonds, swaps, and other interest rate products through Python codes. The final module focuses on real-world model calibration techniques used by practitioners to estimate interest rate processes and derive prices of different financial products. We will illustrate several regression techniques used for interest rate model calibration and end the module by covering the Vasicek and CIR model for pricing fixed income instruments.",

Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them. The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary. In addition, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available.

Before the advent of new digital technologies such as the Internet, personal computer and smartphone, marketing was largely an Analog i.e., physical activity. Today, many marketing activities such as how products are promoted are increasingly Digital in nature. However, we still live in an Analog or physical World. For example, even today, most sales are still conducted in physical stores. Thus, both marketers and consumers must simultaneously navigate both the Analog and Digital worlds on a daily basis.

Much of the course will focus on five questions: What do people get sick, disabled and die from; Why do they suffer from these conditions? Which people are most affected? Why should we care about such concerns? What can be done to address key health issues, hopefully at least cost, as fast as possible, and in sustainable ways? The course will be global in coverage but with a focus on low- and middle-income countries, the health of the poor, and health disparities. Particular attention will be paid throughout the course to health systems issues, the linkages between health and development, and health matters related to global interdependence. The course will cover key concepts and frameworks but be practical in orientation.",

We will use some basic object-oriented concepts to model robot motion and perception. If you don’t know Python but have experience with another language, you should be able to pick up the syntax fairly quickly. If you have no programming experience, you should consider taking Udacity’s Introduction to Computer Science course before attempting this one.The math used will be centered on probability and linear algebra. You don’t need to be an expert in either, but some familiarity with concepts in probability (e.g. probabilities must add to one, conditional probability, and Bayes’ rule) will be extremely helpful. It is possible to learn these concepts during the course, but it will take more work. Knowledge of linear algebra, while helpful, is not required.See the Technology Requirements for using Udacity.",

    "description": "This course offers a brief introduction to the multivariate calculus required to build many common machine learning techniques. We start at the very beginning with a refresher on the rise over run formulation of a slope, before converting this to the formal definition of the gradient of a function. We then start to build up a set of tools for making calculus easier and faster. Next, we learn how to calculate vectors that point up hill on multidimensional surfaces and even put this into action using an interactive game. We take a look at how we can use calculus to build approximations to functions, as well as helping us to quantify how accurate we should expect those approximations to be. We also spend some time talking about where calculus comes up in the training of neural networks, before finally showing you how it is applied in linear regression models. This course is intended to offer an intuitive understanding of calculus, as well as the language necessary to look concepts up yourselves when you get stuck. Hopefully, without going into too much detail, youll still come away with the confidence to dive into some more focused machine learning courses in future.",

You will learn here how to name the different parts of the airplane and how to describe and quantify its geometry. For that, we need now to share a precise vocabulary to describe the airplanes movement and attitude in space, and a refresher on basic general mechanic principles. You will remind how Newtons 2nd law allows you to determine what force must be applied on an apple - or on an airplane, to modify the magnitude and direction of its speed. Coming back on the concepts of kinetic energy and potential energy, you will discover the very useful concept of total height and you will be able to explain how an airplane can quickly exchange speed for altitude, while changes in total height are much slower.",

It’s important to learn to recognize fallacies so that you can avoid being fooled by them. It’s also important to learn about fallacies so that you avoid making fallacious arguments yourself. This course will show you how to identify and avoid many of the fallacies that lead people astray.",

To follow the material in this course, you'll need to enter commands into the shell and make sense of their output. You'll use command-line programs like ping and tcpdump to gather information about computers on the network.You have used the Internet. If you're looking at this page, you pass this requirement! This course does not assume that you are configuring routers or building firewalls in your spare time. It is really intended as an introduction.You have access to a Linux system to run commands. If you're taking this course as part of a Udacity Nanodegree program, you can use the Linux-based development environment that we have set up for you. Find out how to access it here. Many of the practical exercises in this course can be done using another Unix-like shell environment, but you may get different results for some exercises.See the Technology Requirements for using Udacity.",

How much should I tip the cab driver? We usually make these decisions with almost no thought, using what psychologists call heuristics  rules of thumb that enable us to navigate our lives. Without these mental shortcuts, we would be paralyzed by the multitude of daily choices. But in certain circumstances, these shortcuts lead to predictable errors  predictable, that is, if we know what to watch out for. Did you know, for example, that we are naturally biased towards selling investments that are doing well for us, but holding on to those that are doing poorly? Or that we often select sub-optimal insurance payment plans, and routinely purchase insurance that we dont even need? And why do so many of us fail to enroll in our employers corporate retirement plans, even when the employer offers to match our contributions?",

      "Short Intro": "We make thousands of decisions every day. Do I cross the road now, or wait for the oncoming truck to pass? Should I eat fries or a salad for lunch? How much should I tip the cab driver? We usually make these decisions with almost no thought, using what psychologists call “heuristics” – rules of thumb that enable us to navigate our lives. Without these mental shortcuts, we would be paralyzed by the multitude of daily choices. But in certain circumstances, these shortcuts lead to predictable errors – predictable, that is, if we know what to watch out for. Did you know, for example, that we are naturally biased towards selling investments that are doing well for us, but holding on to those that are doing poorly? Or that we often select sub-optimal insurance payment plans, and routinely purchase insurance that we don’t even need? And why do so many of us fail to enroll in our employer’s corporate retirement plans, even when the employer offers to match our contributions?",

Our goal will be to go behind the myth-making and beyond the popularized presentations of relativity in order to gain a deeper understanding of both Einstein the person and the concepts, predictions, and strange paradoxes of his theory. Some of the questions we will address include: How did Einstein come up with his ideas? What was the nature of his genius? What is the meaning of relativity? Whats special about the special theory of relativity? Why did the theory initially seem to be dead on arrival? What does it mean to say that time is the fourth dimension? Can time actually run more slowly for one person than another, and the size of things change depending on their velocity? Is time travel possible, and if so, how? Why cant things travel faster than the speed of light? Is it possible to travel to the center of the galaxy and return in one lifetime? Is there any evidence that definitively confirms the theory, or is it mainly speculation? Why didnt Einstein win the Nobel Prize for the theory of relativity?",

Your pipeline will first transform the dataset into BERT-readable features and store the features in the Amazon SageMaker Feature Store. It will then fine-tune a text classification model to the dataset using a Hugging Face pre-trained model, which has learned to understand the human language from millions of Wikipedia documents. Finally, your pipeline will evaluate the model’s accuracy and only deploy the model if the accuracy exceeds a given threshold.",

    "description": "In this final course, you will put together your knowledge from Courses 1, 2 and 3 to implement a complete RL solution to a problem. This capstone will let you see how each component---problem formulation, algorithm selection, parameter selection and representation design---fits together into a complete solution, and how to make appropriate choices when deploying RL in the real world. This project will require you to implement both the environment to stimulate your problem, and a control agent with Neural Network function approximation. In addition, you will conduct a scientific study of your learning system to develop your ability to assess the robustness of RL agents.

      "Short Intro": "In this final course, you will put together your knowledge from Courses 1, 2 and 3 to implement a complete RL solution to a problem. This capstone will let you see how each component---problem formulation, algorithm selection, parameter selection and representation design---fits together into a complete solution, and how to make appropriate choices when deploying RL in the real world. This project will require you to implement both the environment to stimulate your problem, and a control agent with Neural Network function approximation. In addition, you will conduct a scientific study of your learning system to develop your ability to assess the robustness of RL agents. To use RL in the real world, it is critical to (a) appropriately formalize the problem as an MDP, (b) select appropriate algorithms, (c ) identify what choices in your implementation will have large impacts on performance and (d) validate the expected behaviour of your algorithms.

    "description": "Welcome to our course on Understanding and Strengthening Health Systems for Global Health. During the course we will provide you with an overview of the main elements or building blocks of a health system based on the World Health Organizations guidance. You will have the opportunity to explore four main areas of health systems in global health with particular reference to low and middle income countries. The first area focuses on understanding health service organizations, the challenges. Our second module looks at WHOs six major building blocks or health systems components with particular reference to primary health care and the need for community participation in planning, delivery and assessment of these systems components. in our third module we examine the specific systems component of human resource development and capacity building. The fourth area consists of health policy making and advocacy with stakeholders. This course is geared toward learners who are already involved in managing health and development programs on the ground in low and middle income countries or who are preparing for such a management role. The main lectures will span a four-week period with approximately 2-4 hours of viewing learning materials per week. We have one peer graded essay wherein you will use skills in organizational diagnosis to better understand a challenge in an organization where you are or have worked. There are also quizzes. We hope you will engage with your fellow learners in discussion forums to learn from each other.",

Today, increasing worldwide interest in wine and its complexities and varieties has created an international market valued at 304 billion annually. For the learner who is just getting started in the study of wine, this course will help you take the first steps toward understanding the physiological process of wine tasting. The first module will explore types of wine and help you set up your own tasting. Youll also begin to build a sensory vocabulary. In module 2 you will review classic wine types of the world and set up flights of specific wines. Later well examine the various faults and defects that can appear in wine as well as techniques for spotting problems. In week 4 well delve into the complex world of wine and food pairings, and its seven deadly sins. The course will culminate in a peer review project in which you will apply the knowledge and sensory techniques you have developed throughout the course to assess a specific wine.",

      "Short Intro": "With its roots in ancient cultures as early as 6,000 BC, wine has long been part of the human experience. Today, increasing worldwide interest in wine and its complexities and varieties has created an international market valued at $304 billion annually. For the learner who is just getting started in the study of wine, this course will help you take the first steps toward understanding the physiological process of wine tasting. The first module will explore types of wine and help you set up your own tasting. You’ll also begin to build a sensory vocabulary. In module 2 you will review classic wine types of the world and set up flights of specific wines. Later we’ll examine the various faults and defects that can appear in wine as well as techniques for spotting problems. In week 4 we’ll delve into the complex world of wine and food pairings, and its “seven deadly sins.” The course will culminate in a peer review project in which you will apply the knowledge and sensory techniques you have developed throughout the course to assess a specific wine.",

      "Short Intro": "In this course you will learn how corporations create, capture, and maintain value, going beyond the management of a single line of business. It is thus a complement to (and should typically follow) a course on Business Strategy, which focuses on developing and sustaining competitive advantage for a single business unit. Here, you will be able to better understand and learn the tools to analyze and manage decisions from a corporate-level perspective, which emphasizes the management of multiple businesses and multiple stakeholders. Examples of such decisions include vertical integration, diversification, mergers and acquisitions, strategic alliances, international expansion, global strategy, corporate governance and corporate social responsibility.",
