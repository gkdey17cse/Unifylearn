You’ll learn what these terms mean and build them into your app.Relationships: When the pieces of your app start communicating, interesting things can happen. In this lesson you’ll learn the basics of Salesforce relationship fields.Validation Rules: If you’ve ever incorrectly entered your credit card number into a website, you already know about validation rules. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to build them into your app.Formulas and Summaries: These tools let you easily keep track of quantifiable things like money spent, customers contacted, or tickets sold.

In this lesson you’ll learn how and when (and why) to use master-detail and lookup relationships in the apps you build.Many-to-Many Relationships: You’ll learn how to use a junction object to add flexibility into your data model.Customizing the User Interface: Good apps should be easy to use! In this lesson you’ll learn how to configure the layout of your app to make sure the UI is simple and intuitive.Schema Builder: There are many ways to get things done in Salesforce. In this lesson you’ll start using the schema builder to understand how your app works.Data Loading: This is a convenient way to get lots of data onto your app at once.One-to-Many Relationships: These relationships let the pieces of your app talk to each other.

These let you gather data according to specific criteria and display it in neat rows and columns.Charts: These let you graphically summarize the information in a report.Dashboards: Different people want access to different information. A dashboard is a collection of charts that give specific people in your organization exactly the information that they need in real-time.Views: Data is good, but sometimes you have too much. Views let you selectively and quickly display only the data you care about.Reports: These let you gather related information into one place.

Workflows let you automate processes like these, such as sending an email, assigning a task, or updating a field.Approval Processes: You don’t want every job to be completely automated. Sometimes you need someone to step in and say “this looks good.” Approval processes add a human element to your automated tasks.Workflows: There are situations where a series of steps need to happen in sequence: first do this, then do that.

Upon completion, learners will have an understanding of how the forces between electric charges are described by fields, and how these fields are related to electrical circuits. They will gain experience in solving physics problems with tools such as graphical analysis, algebra, vector analysis, and calculus.  The course follows the typical progression of topics of a first-semester university physics course:  charges, electric forces, electric fields potential, magnetic fields, currents, magnetic moments, electromagnetic induction, and circuits.  Each module contains reading links to a free textbook, complete video lectures, conceptual quizzes, and a set of homework problems.  Once the modules are completed, the course ends with an exam.  This comprehensive course series is similar in detail and rigor to what is taught on-campus.  It will thoroughly prepare learners for their upcoming introductory physics courses, or more advanced courses in physics.",

In this introductory course, youll learn about various roles in IT support that are common in healthcare. IT support staff play critical roles in many different healthcare venues. In addition to helping clinics, hospitals, and emergency rooms, you may end up providing support in a skilled nursing facility, ambulatory surgical center, virtual care setting, or even a patients home! On any given day, you may interact with nurses, physicians, pharmacists, physical therapists, social workers, other allied health professionals, patients or caregivers. Each of these individuals rely on IT support specialists to help them maintain a high reliability healthcare organization. As you learn about what makes Health IT unique, we hope you find inspiration in the stories shared by some of our very own IT support staff at Johns Hopkins. Theyll talk to you about the most common problems they help resolve as well as the complexity and range of issues that arise.

While this course focuses heavily on outbound transactions, some inbound rules i.e., non-US taxpayers doing business in the United States will be discussed.

      "Short Intro": "This introductory course provides a framework for incorporating integrative therapies into your work with clients or patients.  By the end of the course, you will be able to assess if integrative therapies are good options in specific situations, as well as educate patients and colleagues about benefits and risks.  You will be confident discussing the evidence base for integrative therapies in general, with an understanding of some of the challenges of research in this area, and able to identify reliable sources of evidence-based information. You will leave with the skills to  partner with patients or clients around use of  these therapies and a plan to introduce integrative therapies in your work or other setting.",
