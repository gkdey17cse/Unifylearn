Some of the exercises in this course involve using a Unix-style command-line interface to enter commands, run Python programs, and navigate directories.\r\nIf you have taken our course on Git and Github, the level of command-line use in this course is similar.\r\nYou don't need to be a Web programmer. This course does include a small Web application and some HTML and JavaScript in examples, but you will not need to make changes in these languages.\r\nYou don't need any previous database experience. This course is an entry-level introduction to relational databases.\r\nYou need a programming text editor (such as Sublime Text) installed on your computer.

    "description": "Welcome to Introduction to Numerical Mathematics. This is designed to give you part of the mathematical foundations needed to work in computer science in any of its strands, from business to visual digital arts, music, games. At any stage of the problem solving and modelling stage you will require numerical and computational tools. We get you started in binary and other number bases, some tools to make sense of sequences of numbers, how to represent space numerical using coordinates, how to study variations of quantities via functions and their graphs. For this we prepared computing and everyday life problems for you to solve using these tools, from sending secret messages to designing computer graphics.",
