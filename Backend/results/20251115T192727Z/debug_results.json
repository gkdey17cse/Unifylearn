If you need to build these skills, a good starting point is Udacity’s Introduction to Java with additional comfortability needed identifying and debugging compile & run-time errors.No prior experience is assumed in Ubuntu, git, Maven, Redis, Flask (Python) or d3 (Javascript).  Python is useful, but optional.  A basic course such as CS101 or OO in Python would be helpful.See the Technology Requirements for using Udacity.",
