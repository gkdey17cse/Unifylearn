Some of the exercises in this course involve using a Unix-style command-line interface to enter commands, run Python programs, and navigate directories.\r\nIf you have taken our course on Git and Github, the level of command-line use in this course is similar.\r\nYou don't need to be a Web programmer. This course does include a small Web application and some HTML and JavaScript in examples, but you will not need to make changes in these languages.\r\nYou don't need any previous database experience. This course is an entry-level introduction to relational databases.\r\nYou need a programming text editor (such as Sublime Text) installed on your computer.

A basic familiarity with the terminal, working with files and command-line programs, and the git version control software will be very useful.You will read and write object-oriented Python code using a text editor, and will read Python module documentation to learn about new modules. You will also write code that sends HTML to browsers, so a basic knowledge of HTML markup will come in handy. CSS and JavaScript are not required.This course does not use a virtual machine (VM). You will be installing and writing software on your own computer. You will need a text editor and the ability to install software.Elements of this course require communicating with web services including Github and Heroku.See the Technology Requirements for using Udacity.",

If you need a refresher on any of these topics, you can check out these courses:\r\n\r\nIntro to Python Programming\r\nInferential Statistics\r\nDescriptive Statistics\r\n\r\n  One additional course that would be nice to have is Intro to Data Science, as this will get you familiar with scientific problem-solving.  However, completion of that class isn't required for success.  We will also use a tiny bit of git, which you can also learn about on Udacity.One thing that we don’t require is previous exposure to machine learning.  If you’re a machine learning beginner, you’re in the right place.See the Technology Requirements for using Udacity.",
