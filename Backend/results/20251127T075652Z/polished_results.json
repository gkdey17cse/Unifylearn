But you'd like to know more about what's going on \"under the hood\" when you use HTTP.You can use the Linux command line. To follow the material in this course, you'll need to enter commands into the shell and make sense of their output. You'll use command-line programs like ping and tcpdump to gather information about computers on the network.You have used the Internet. If you're looking at this page, you pass this requirement! This course does not assume that you are configuring routers or building firewalls in your spare time. It is really intended as an introduction.You have access to a Linux system to run commands. If you're taking this course as part of a Udacity Nanodegree program, you can use the Linux-based development environment that we have set up for you. Find out how to access it here. Many of the practical exercises in this course can be done using another Unix-like shell environment, but you may get different results for some exercises.See the Technology Requirements for using Udacity.",
