You’ll learn what these terms mean and build them into your app.Relationships: When the pieces of your app start communicating, interesting things can happen. In this lesson you’ll learn the basics of Salesforce relationship fields.Validation Rules: If you’ve ever incorrectly entered your credit card number into a website, you already know about validation rules.

In this lesson you’ll learn how and when (and why) to use master-detail and lookup relationships in the apps you build.Many-to-Many Relationships: You’ll learn how to use a junction object to add flexibility into your data model.Customizing the User Interface: Good apps should be easy to use! In this lesson you’ll learn how to configure the layout of your app to make sure the UI is simple and intuitive.Schema Builder: There are many ways to get things done in Salesforce. In this lesson you’ll start using the schema builder to understand how your app works.Data Loading: This is a convenient way to get lots of data onto your app at once.One-to-Many Relationships: These relationships let the pieces of your app talk to each other.

A dashboard is a collection of charts that give specific people in your organization exactly the information that they need in real-time.Views: Data is good, but sometimes you have too much.

Workflows let you automate processes like these, such as sending an email, assigning a task, or updating a field.Approval Processes: You don’t want every job to be completely automated. Sometimes you need someone to step in and say “this looks good.” Approval processes add a human element to your automated tasks.Workflows: There are situations where a series of steps need to happen in sequence: first do this, then do that.
